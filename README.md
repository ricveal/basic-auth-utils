## The problem

I'm usually repeating a section of code for extract credentials (username and password) given an authorization header.
This utility wants to extract this logic to reuse it across my different projects.

## This solution

It's a simple utility function which, process your request headers and return an object with the username and the password or an Error if:

- The authorization (or Authorization) header is not given.
- Its format is not correct.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

Once it's installed as dependency, you only have to import it and use it with a `headers` object:

const credentials = getUsernameAndPasswordFromAuthBasic(headers)
// credentials = { username: "user", password: "test" }
```
